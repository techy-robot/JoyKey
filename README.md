# JoyKey
This is a small macropad that simultaneously acts as game controller and an entertainment device. 

The name is inspired by the Nintendo JoyCon portmanteau (Joystick Controller) except I have replaced the 2nd word with "Keypad" (Joystick Keypad). See [name ideas](name%20ideas.md) for other things I came up with.

# Features
- Customizable macro pad using KMK firmware
- Game controller mimicking a joy-con
- Offline games that can be played on the display with no connections
- Small handheld size
- Linear keys


# Main Components
- 6 RGB Cherry mx keys up front
- 2 right-angle RGB keys on the top for triggers
- 1 Analog Joystick
- 1 flat volume dial on the side
- 128x64 px monochrome display near the top
- SEEED Xaio RP2040 
- Lipo Battery & charging system
- Wireless chip

# A Note on Project Management
This project is managed transparently in this very repo. I am using Obsidian.md as my notetaking, documentation, and project management tool. A lot of the markdown files you will see in this repo might look a bit weird; that is due to the Wiki-links instead of markdown links and the YAML file front-matter that Obsidian supports. My system works well for one person, but I'm not sure how future proof this system is. You can find my sample vault here, which explains more: [GitHub - techy-robot/Project-Management-Obsidian-Sample-Vault](https://github.com/techy-robot/Project-Management-Obsidian-Sample-Vault).
